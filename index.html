				<p>I am a PhD student advised by <a href="https://pauldownen.com" target="_blank">Paul Downen</a> 
					working in Formal Methods and Type Systems.</p> <br>

				<p>My research focuses on Programming Language (PL) theory, 
					with a particular emphasis on the application of formal methods and type systems to ensure the correctness, 
					safety, and security of software systems. My work spans two main areas: the use of mechanized logic to 
					verify software and its compilation, and the exploration of dynamic information flow control (IFC) in programs, 
					particularly in relation to security.</p> <br>

					<p>I am also interested in applying PL techniques to cryptography which extends 
						my research to the formalization and verification of cryptographic protocols, 
						such as differential privacy and zero-knowledge proofs, using the EasyCrypt proof assistant.</p> <br>
					
					<p>Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to the fields of programming languages theory and formal verification, 
					leveraging proof assistants to build safe-by-construction software.</p> <br>

					<p>Outside of research I enjoy traveling, exploring the outdoors, and cooking.</p>
